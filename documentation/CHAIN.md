# CHAIN

To transfer control to the specified program and pass (chain) variables to it from the current program.

## Syntax

`CHAIN[MERGE] filename[,[line][,[ALL][,DELETE range]]]`

## Comments

`MERGE` overlays the current program with the called program.

## Note

The called program must be an ASCII file (previously saved with the `a` option) if it is to be merged (see the [MERGE](MERGE) command).

*filename* is the name of the program that is called to be chained to. The .BAS extension is assumed unless another is specified.

*line* is a line number or an expression that corresponds to a line number in the called program. It is the starting point for execution of the called program. For example the following begins execution of `PROG1.BAS` at line 1000:

```vb
10 CHAIN "PROG1", 1000
```

If *line* is omitted, execution begins at the first line.

*line* is not affected by a [RENUM](RENUM) command. However, the line numbers in the specified range are affected by a [RENUM](RENUM) command.

`ALL` specifies that every variable in the current program is chained to the called program. For example:

```vb
20 CHAIN "PROG1", 1000, ALL
```

If the `ALL` option is omitted, the current program must contain a [COMMON](COMMON) statement to list the variables that are passed.

`CHAIN` executes a [RESTORE](RESTORE) before it runs the program that it is to be chained to. The [READ](READ) statement then gets the first item in the [DATA](DATA) statement. Reading will not resume where it left off in the program that is being chained.

After an overlay is executed and used for a specific purpose, it is usually desirable to delete it so that a new overlay may be brought in. To do this, use the [DELETE](DELETE) command.

The `CHAIN` statement with the [MERGE](MERGE) command leaves the files open and preserves the current option base setting.

If the [MERGE](MERGE) command is omitted, the [OPTION BASE](OPTION-BASE) setting is preserved, and `CHAIN` preserves no variable types or user-defined functions for use by the chained program. That is, any [DEFINT](DEFINT), [DEFSNG](DEFSNG), [DEFDBL](DEFDBL), [DEFSTR](DEFSTR), or [DEF FN](DEF-FN) statement containing shared variables must be restated in the chained program.

When using the merge command, place user-defined functions before any `CHAIN MERGE` statements in the program. Otherwise, they will be undefined after the merge is complete.
