# REM

Allows explanatory comments or remarks on a program line.

## Syntax

`REM` *comment*

## Comments

*comment* is any text.

QBasic ignores comment lines unless they contain compiler metacommands.

QBasic supports the use of  a single quotation mark (') instead of the `REM` statement.

## Example

```vb
REM This is a comment
'This is a comment
```
