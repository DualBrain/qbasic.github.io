# BSAVE

To save portions of user memory on the specified device.

## Syntax

`BSAVE filename,offset,length`

## Comments

*filename* is a valid string expression containing the filename.

*offset* is a valid numeric expression within the range of 0 to 65535. This is the offset into the segment, declared by the last [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG), where saving is to start.

*length* is a valid numeric expression within the range of 0 to 65535, specifying the length of the memory image to be saved.

If *filename* is less than one character, a "Bad File Number" error is issued and the load is aborted.

Execute a [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement before the `BSAVE`. The last known [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) address is always used for the save.

The [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement must be used to set up the segment address to the start of the screen buffer. An offset of 0 and a length of 16384 specify that the entire 16K screen buffer is to be saved.

## Example

```vb
10 DEF SEG=&HB800
20 BSAVE"PICTURE", 0, 16384
```

The [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement in line 10 points the segment at the screen buffer.

The `BSAVE` command in line 20 saves the screen buffer in the file named picture.
