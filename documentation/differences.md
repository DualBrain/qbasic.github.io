# Differences

In the process of building QBasic, there will be decisions made that affect *potential* compatibility with other implementations of BASIC.

## Dartmouth

*References: Documentation circa May 1964 and October 1964*

## MBASIC

*Reference: MICROSOFT BASIC by Ken Knecht*

- The [PRINT](PRINT) statement does not support back-to-back string literals due to QBasic's support for escaped quotation marks.
- String literals must have both pairs of quotation marks to be considered a valid string literal.

## Microsoft GW-BASIC

*Reference: GW-BASIC 3.23.*

- The [PRINT](PRINT) statement does not support back-to-back string literals due to QBasic's support for escaped quotation marks.
- String literals must have both pairs of quotation marks to be considered a valid string literal.

## Microsoft QBasic

*Reference: QBasic 1.1.*

- The [PRINT](PRINT) statement does not support back-to-back string literals due to QBasic's support for escaped quotation marks.
- String literals must have both pairs of quotation marks to be considered a valid string literal.
- Added support for the `PRESERVE` keyword / functionality for the [REDIM](REDIM) statement.
