# SIN

To calculate the trigonometric sine of *x*, in radians.

## Syntax

`SIN(x)`

## Comments

`SIN(x)` is calculated in single-precision.

To obtain `SIN(x)` when *x* is in degrees, use `SIN(x*Ï€/180)`.

## Example

```vb
PRINT SIN(1.5)
```

```text
 .9974951
```

The sine of `1.5` radians is `.9974951` (single-precision).
