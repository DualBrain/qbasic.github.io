# BLOAD

To load an image file anywhere in user memory.

## Syntax

`BLOAD filename[,offset]`

## Comments

*filename* is a valid string expression containing the device and filename.

*offset* is a valid numeric expression within the range of 0 to 65535. This is the offset into the segment, declared by the last [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement, where loading is to start.

If offset is omitted, the offset specified at [BSAVE](BSAVE) is assumed; that is, the file is loaded into the same location it was saved from.

## Note

`BLOAD` does not perform an address range check. It is possible to `BLOAD` anywhere in memory. You must not `BLOAD` over the BASIC stack space, a BASIC program, or the BASIC variable area.

While `BLOAD` and [BSAVE](BSAVE) are useful for loading and saving machine language programs, they are not restricted to them. The [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement lets you specify any segment as the source or target for `BLOAD` and [BSAVE](BSAVE). For example, this allows the video screen buffer to be read from or written to the diskette. `BLOAD` and [BSAVE](BSAVE) are useful in saving and displaying graphic images.

## Examples

```vb
10 DEF SEG=&HB800
20 BLOAD"PICTURE", 0
```

The [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement in line 10 points the segment at the screen buffer.

The [DEF SEG](DEF-SEG) statement in line 10 and the offset of 0 in line 20 guarantee that the correct address is used.

The `BLOAD` command in line 20 loads the file named picture into the screen buffer.

## Note

The [BSAVE](BSAVE) example in the next section illustrates how the file named picture is saved.
