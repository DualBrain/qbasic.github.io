# ON...GOTO

To branch to one of several specified line numbers, depending on the value returned when an expression is evaluated.

## Syntax

`ON expression GOTO line numbers`

`ON expression GOSUB line numbers`

## Comments

In the `ON...GOTO` statement, the value of expression determines which line number in the list will be used for branching. For example, if the value is 3, the third line number in the list will be destination of the branch. If the value is a non-integer, the fractional portion is rounded.

In the `ON...GOSUB` statement, each line number in the list must be the first line number of a subroutine.

If the value of expression is zero or greater than the number of items in the list (but less than or equal to 255), BASIC continues with the next executable statement.

If the value of expression is negative, or greater than 255, an `Illegal function call` error occurs.

## Examples

```vb
100 IF R < 1 OR R > 4 THEN PRINT "ERROR" : END
```

If the integer value of R is less than 1, or greater than 4, program execution ends.

```vb
200 ON R GOTO 150, 300, 320, 390
```

If `R=1`, the program goes to line `150`.

If `R=2`, the program branches to line `300` and continues from there. If `R=3`, the branch will be to line `320`, and so on.
