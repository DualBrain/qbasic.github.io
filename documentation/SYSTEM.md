# SYSTEM

To return to MS-DOS.

## Syntax

SYSTEM

## Comments

Save your program before pressing RETURN, or the program will be lost.

The `SYSTEM` command closes all the files before it returns to MS-DOS. If you entered BASIC through a batch file from MS-DOS, the `SYSTEM` command returns you to the batch file, which continues executing at the point it left off.

## Examples

```text
SYSTEM
A>
```
